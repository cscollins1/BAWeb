            <h4>About</h4>
            <p>
              Paul has grown up in Richmond, Virginia where he attended Virginia Commonwealth
              where he received an undergraduate degree in piano performance and then a Masters 
              in Church Music from Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. Paul has happily served
              as the Worship Pastor at Ironbridge Church since 1998. He and his wife Sarah have 
              schooled their boys, Paul and Thomas, at home for the last 14 years and enjoy giving 
              back to the homeschool community by teaching at Bridge Academy. Working with students 
              to encourage them to grow not only as Christians, but also as musicians, has really 
              been a blessing in his life.
