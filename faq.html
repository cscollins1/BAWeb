                        After all of the required documents have been submitted and accepted you will then need to activate your iGrade accounts 
                        through links sent through your provided email addresses. Each student will have their own iGrade account and each student 
                        must have at least one parent account linked to their student account. A family with multiple students registered at Bridge
                        Academy will have one (or more) parent account that will link to each student account. As an example, a family with two 
                        students will have 3 accounts. One parent account and two student accounts, but will receive four emails (one for each student 
                        account and one for each student account to link to their parent account. Parents will be able to log on to their parent account
                        and easily toggle between their student accounts. Students may not view their siblings accounts.

                    <p>
                        There is no specific number of credits a homeschooler must have to graduate. It is up to the parent to decide when the course of
                        study for the student is completed. At that point, the parent will issue a completed transcript (a record of grades 9-12) and a 
                        parent-signed homeschool diploma. If you chose, you could use public school credit standards as a guide, but they are not required 
                        for homeschool students. Colleges are accustomed to receiving different numbers of credits from school districts in multiple states. 
                        College admissions officers will be looking at the types of courses the student completed–easy or difficult, along with grades, 
                        extracurricular activities, and the student’s SAT or ACT scores. Requirements differ from state colleges to private colleges–some 
                        schools are more selective than others. You will find admission requirements on college websites.  This could help you plan your 
                        high school program.

                        Bridge Academy is University Modeled, in that your student will be expected to attend their classes every weekand may be required to 
                        complete assignments for each class. In most cases your student should spend some time each day completing assignments for the classes
                        they are enrolled in. Homework will vary depending on the class type and grade level. Core classes such as English, Math, History, and 
                        Science will require more dedicated time than that of electives such as Culinary Arts, P.E., or Art. Determining the exact amount of 
                        time your student will spend on each subject is very difficult as it varies depending on the dificulty of each class. Fell free to reach
                        out to the teacher of any specific class to get a better idea of the required workload of their class.

                        Bridge Academy is here to help support you in your home schooling needs, we are not here to replace you! We fully expect you to remain 
                        engaged and the head of your student's academic needs while your student is enrolled in classes with us at Bridge Academy. Topics and 
                        lessons are presented in class but class time with your student is limited. This means that while at home your student may need additional 
                        help. Your student's teacher may be able to help or direct you to additional resources as needed if given ample time to do so. Please do 
                        not reach out to your student's teacher late Thursday for help on an assignment that is due Friday.

                        Parents are responsible for obtaining textbooks and other school supplies for their student. We are mindful of the financial 
                        sacrifices families make to home-educate their students and put a great deal of effort into choosing curriculum that is both 
                        academically strong as well as as cost effective.  Bellow you will find a list of a few ways you may choose to obtain the 
                        required textbooks.

                    <p>
                        Books, if available, may be rented for the year for a $5 non-refundable fee and a post dated check for the replacement value 
                        of the book. When the book is returned at the end of the year, the post dated check will be returned to you. If you do not 
                        return the book, your check will be cashed and the book you rented will be replaced. Books are available on a first come, first 
                        served basis. We do NOT have enough books for all students in all classes. Hedi Juback is our Lending Librarian and can be

                        Used curriculum sales in the area are a great way to find books for your student. Bridge Academy hopes to have another

                        <a href="www.christianbook.com">Christian Bookstore</a> as well as many other online websites offer textbooks. Check the course 
                        description pages, as your student's instructor may have posted a link to the reccomended textbook.

                        If you have difficulty in finding a required textbook, please contact the teacher of the class the book is required for. They can 
                        often most easily direct you.

                        Due to COVID restrictions we are not able to offer lunch for purchase for the 20/21 school year, 
                        however, we will begin offering individually wrapped snacks and drinks for 50 cents after Christmas 
                        break. All profit from the sell of these goodies will go toward our benevolence fund to help our 
                        Bridge families that are facing unexpected financial hardships. If possible, we will begin offering 
                        lunch options again beginning with the 21/22 school year.
