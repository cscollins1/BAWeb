        <h1>Welcome to Bridge Academy!</h1>
         <p class="1">Bridge Academy  is a  homeschool co-op that has been serving Christian homeschooling families in the Chesterfield area since 2014. You will find academically strong, Christ-centered classes for families with students from grades K -12th! Bridge Academy is intended to serve homeschooling families only and is not able to serve families who wish to participate in public school and the co-op simultaneously. We are here to offer support, not replace you.</p>
        <p class="2">In addition to academics and electives, we offer opportunities to serve in community based missions as well as social activities...both for students and families.</p>
         <p class="3">We hope you will consider Bridge Academy when choosing academic support for your homeschooled student. Contact Emily Kirtlan at etkirtlan@gmail.com or complete the form found under the "Register" tab (found on the above toggle bar) to schedule a phone conversation or a tour of our facilities and to see if Bridge Academy is able to help meet your home schooling needs. All families new to Bridge Academy must meet with an approved staff member either in person or on the phone before registration will be considered.</p>
